# Typescript-React-Starter
Starter project for a React project using Typescript.

This is just something I put together based on information [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html) and other stuff. This project is intended as a lightweight starter kit for my projects.

# Getting Started
First make sure Nodejs is installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/.

Then using terminal:-

- Install the Typescript compiler if you don't have it: `npm install typescript -g`
- Create a project folder and navigate to it
- `git clone https://github.com/Krelborn/typescript-react-starter.git` alternatively just download the repository as a zip file.
- Modify package.json and get hacking!

# Commands

`npm start` - Build the project
